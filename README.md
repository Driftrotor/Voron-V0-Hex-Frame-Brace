# Voron V0 Hex Frame Brace
 Frame bracing but with Hex

I wanted to add some extra Hex features to the Frame Bracing i had created a while ago.
I mean let's face it, We ALL need more Hex in our builds!

These simple to print braces will help firm up your V0 while adding a touch of style!

Coming in two flavours (Normal and Stronger) you can choose what to use!
